# FinWell
FinWell is a budgeting app designed by me to help teens and young adults manage money easily. Users can add transactions, set and update savings goals, or schedule recurring payments. The analytics page in the sidebar shows your spending with helpful tips using GenKit, making financial habits simpler to keep track of.
